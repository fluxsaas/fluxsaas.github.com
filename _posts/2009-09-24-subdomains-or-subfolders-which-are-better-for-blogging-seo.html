  I recently had to decide whether to use a subdomain <code>blog.2manycolours.com</code> or an subdirectory <code>2manycolours.com/blog</code>
  for the Wordpress blog of my new project. As i'm not a SEO-Guy i

  <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/">some</a> 
  <a href="http://risetothetop.techwyse.com/search-engine-optimization/should-i-use-subdomains-or-subfolders-for-seo-benefit/">articles</a> 
  about the issue.
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion i decided to use a Subfolder because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search engines view Subdomains as separate sites. Therefore they have the equivalency of separate domains.</li>
  <li>Sub domains have their own entity</li>
  <li>With a subfolder, both the inbound and internal linking structure favor the entire site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  But could i just setup 10 Subdomains to get more results listed in the google search ?
</p>

<p>
  Nope, because:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Google will show up to two results from each hostname/subdomain of a domain name.

  Thats not the way it works...
